Hello @wcedit  . It was hard to find you and find how can i write you! :/
How users can provide feedback on your edited map Green Circle TD? Maybe you will create discord and put URL in map loading screen?
i want to:
1. thank you, changes are really nice.
2. suggest more changes like:
- ability to turn off leavers spawns
-reduce SFX/change unit types/else from level 35 starting to reduce HUGE LAGGS
most of matches ends after laggs on level 35, everyone is leaving and deals starting worse and worse
-also need a vote for a kick leaker, or authomatic kick system, like LMS in City TD or HOG TD or Trollforged TD
-some hints/tips on screen will be great. because every match i need to explain, where u build ward, or dont forget buy castle/wisps or update hero
-other version have option to update hero ability, not only DMG level, this will be great to implement here too
-add aura range checker please

My nick in Discord: Ragnarocker#0198 (54512996) - but im not use it mostly
My BattleNet: Ragnarocker#2737
I will be glad to hear any answer on my message, any updates of map will make me glad much more!
